How often have you found yourself in a rut without any explanation for it? Your family's fine, your job's going great and your day's never been better yet you feel somehow off. Turns out 95% of our thinking is subconscious and we don't have control over it. Or do we?

In this episode we speak to Chris BarÃ©z-Brown & Jim Lusty, founders of Talk It Out - an innovative app that brings out your subconscious thinking and allows you to look at what it is that you are really saying to yourself and the feelings that's creating.

We also talk about the benefits and challenges that come with being an entrepreneur, the importance of surrounding yourself with the right people, and how a mindset change can unleash the entrepreneur within.
