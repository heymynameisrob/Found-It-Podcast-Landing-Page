This week on the Found It! podcast we talk to Anishka who is the founder of the LegalTech SaaS platform 'resolv'. 

Anishka spotted a number of problems & challenges through her 12 years of experience working in the legal space - a sector that's lacked digital transformation. 

In this episode, we discuss how Covid in particular and working from home was impactful for that sector which just wasn't prepared for remote working. 

We also talk about the launch of her new product and how it helps bridge that gap and solve a problem in that space.
